# Facial-Attendance-System

A Facial attendance system was created to mark present or absent based on the facial features of a person. The model was trained on the images of athletes (Messi, Ronaldo, Neymar etc.). 
The images of these players were provided to the model which would then mark them as absent or present in a seperate Excel file along with the timestamps.
